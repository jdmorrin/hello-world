# hello-world
following the github tutorial

My name is Juan David Morrell Rincon
I am currently a software development student.
I am largely going treading this path alone. None of my friends or close family members have any experience in coding or in any tech field.
Most of my family members are engineers or academics. 

Hopefully, I will graduate by the end of Summer 2022.

I want to work for Lockheed-Martin.
